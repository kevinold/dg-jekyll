<p><strong>WASHINGTON, DC, June 2, 2011</strong>: <a href="../../index.html">DICOM Grid</a>, a global cloud platform for medical imaging applications, is showcasing HL7 integration capabilities, image-exchange content notification and updates to its zero-footprint image viewer at SIIM 2011, the annual meeting of the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine at Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center June 2-5.</p>

<p>The DICOM Grid viewer enables authorized users to securely access and share medical images and reports stored in a vendor neutral archive (VNA) from any HTML5-capable web browser. You do not have to install software to view images across any image modality or picture archiving and communications system (PACS). Protected health information (PHI) is safe because data are not stored in the browser or local system.</p>

<p>DICOM Grid’s viewer gives providers efficient access to imaging data stored in the cloud VNA. Integration is supported with electronic health records (EHRs), PACS and other third-party applications. </p>

<p>“The latest application updates, including new features to our HTML5 image viewer, are examples of how DICOM Grid’s cloud-based platform is improving access to medical imaging data, which reduces duplicate exams and radiation exposure”, said Todd McNitt, DICOM Grid Senior Vice President Sales and Marketing.
SIIM 2011 attendees are invited to visit DICOM Grid at booth 405 June 2-5 for a live demonstration. </p>
