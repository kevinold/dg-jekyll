<p><strong>PHOENIX, AZ (November 10, 2012)</strong>– DICOM Grid, a leader in cloud-based medical image exchange, announced today they have partnered with Doximity to implement its single sign-on button allowing for streamlined physician communication and information sharing. The single-sign on button enables authorized users of Doximity, the online professional network designed exclusively for U.S. physicians, to easily access DICOM Grid’s proprietary medical image exchange platform. In the same way that websites allow secure log in using social media credentials, DICOM Grid allows Doximity's directory of physicians to access images immediately over a secure, HIPPA-compliant platform. </p>


<p>"DICOM Grid is dedicated to providing physicians with the tools they need to instantly access time-sensitive images. We are thrilled to partner with a company like Doximity who shares this objective. In working with Doximity, we aim to provide physicians with the most efficient way to communicate and share information online," said Morris Panner, CEO of DICOM Grid.</p>

<p>Doctors who are members of the Doximity network will be able to further enhance their communication and consulting arrangements via DICOM Grid. This integration allows for streamlined access to DICOM Grid applications as well as an improvement to how referring physicians and physicians at the point of care communicate regarding their patients.</p>

<p>"Our mission is to make it easier for doctors to communicate and improve patient care," Jeff Tangney, CEO of Doximity said. "We built a closed yet all-encompassing medical platform and are thrilled to welcome DICOM Grid to our growing community. In creating this new community of physicians and partners we are helping to share the future of medical communication."</p>

<p>The single sign-on feature is now available on the DICOM Grid website, <a href="http://www.dicomgrid.com">www.dicomgrid.com</a>.</p>
