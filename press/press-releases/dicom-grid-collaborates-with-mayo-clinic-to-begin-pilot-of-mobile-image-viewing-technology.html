<h1>DICOM Grid Collaborates with Mayo Clinic to Begin Pilot of Mobile Image Viewing Technology</h1>

		<div><p><em>DICOM Grid powers mobile imaging applications to enhance image distribution</em></p>
<p><strong>PHOENIX (September 20, 2012)</strong> – <a href="../../index.html">DICOM Grid</a> announced today that it has entered into a collaborative agreement for continued development of a mobile platform medical image viewer.  The intent is to enhance image distribution between Mayo Clinic, its physicians and referring physicians. The medical image viewer is specifically designed for both browser-based and iPad devices.</p>

<p>High tech imaging studies carry a big price tag: over 400 million medical procedures per year in the US involve at least one medical image, and 20% of imaging tests are repeated because different physician’s offices cannot access earlier data resulting in $26.5 billion dollars in healthcare costs. DICOM Grid’s proprietary mobile technology allows doctors to exchange and view images without the geographic or institutional boundaries that affect traditional sharing of medical images. The mobile application allows doctors and providers to send medical images to a facility in advance of a physician visit so that hospitals can more efficiently evaluate and treat patients. “Mobile image viewing is paramount to our ability to deliver efficient, cost-effective patient care,” said Dr. Jeremy Friese, Associate Chair of Radiology at Mayo Clinic. “For the Mayo system specifically, allowing both referring and Mayo physicians easy access to medical images at the point of care will prove to be very beneficial.” DICOM Grid has developed an extensive work-flow engine that enables the routing and sharing of medical images and related data over both local and wide-area networks. This flexibility has been critical for enabling large multi-hospital institutions such as the Mayo Clinic to access and share medical images with physicians across a variety of mobile platforms. The Mayo Clinic and DICOM Grid will work together to integrate their expertise from the clinical and software development perspectives to fully maximize the impact this technology could have on patient care. “We are excited to work with one of the world’s leading health care providers to realize the power of mobility and information exchange in today’s changing health care environment,” said Morris Panner, CEO of DICOM Grid. “We are creating a system that enables doctors to see medical imaging studies on a mobile device as easily as a consumer can access his or her online banking information.” The program will begin in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will be used internally at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Upon completion of the pilot, DICOM Grid will evaluate the potential of making this mobile technology available to other medical providers.</p>
