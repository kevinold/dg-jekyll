		<div><p><em>Series A investment to fuel market growth of DICOM&rsquo;s cloud-based medical imaging platform</em></p>
<p><strong>PHOENIX – Nov.  4, 2010 </strong>– <a href="../../index.html">DICOM Grid</a>, a global cloud platform for medical imaging applications, today announced that it has secured $7.5 million in Series A financing from a syndicate led by Canaan Partners with participation from CHL Medical Partners and private investors. The investment will accelerate DICOM Grid&rsquo;s market expansion and product development to meet the need for an easy-to-use and cost-effective solution for medical imaging management. Stephen Bloch, M.D., a general partner at Canaan Partners, Myles Greenberg, M.D., a general partner at CHL Medical Partners, and Steven Yecies, CEO at Chronic Health Capital, have joined DICOM Grid&rsquo;s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the explosion of medical imaging and overall physician-to-physician collaboration mandated for federal Meaningful Use financial incentives, the healthcare industry needs the ability to affordably archive, access and exchange medical images anytime and anywhere regardless of where they were created,&rdquo; explained DICOM Grid CEO Mike Wall. &ldquo;DICOM Grid leverages the most advanced Internet-based technologies to offer the comprehensive, scalable and interoperable solution that the market requires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currently, many imaging studies are snail mailed or hand delivered on sometimes unreadable CDs by patients and messengers. DICOM Grid eliminates this 20th century holdover that delays care and results in costly duplicate imaging studies. By providing physicians with 24 x 7 access to medical imaging studies over the Internet, DICOM Grid also improves the quality of patient care and provides an unparalleled business continuity solution, even during a natural disaster or equipment failure. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Having timely access to medical images can be vexing as patients move between doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers,&rdquo; according to Stephen Bloch, M.D., general partner at Canaan Partners. &ldquo;As a physician, I am frustrated when key data is lost or unavailable when treating a patient. As a venture investor, I look for companies that solve fundamental disconnections in healthcare and put the patient first. By providing secure and simple access to medical images &lsquo;in the cloud&rsquo;, DICOM Grid can reduce unnecessary and redundant tests, lower radiation exposure to patients and make medical images immediately available to improve patient care.&rdquo;</p>
