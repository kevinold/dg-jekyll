<p><strong>Phoenix – </strong><strong>April 7, 2011 – </strong><a href="../../index.html">DICOM Grid</a><strong>, </strong>a global cloud platform for medical imaging applications, today announced the appointment of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36981810@N07/5595111931/" target="_blank">Todd McNitt</a> as senior vice president of sales and marketing. McNitt, who brings 18 years of domestic/international sales and marketing experience in healthcare IT and imaging to the newly created position, will oversee national sales strategy and business development for the company.</p>
<p>&quot;DICOM Grid&rsquo;s rapid growth has allowed us to expand our national footprint into large integrated delivery networks (IDNs), hospitals and health systems, and medical imaging facilities,&rdquo; said Mike Wall, CEO of DICOM Grid. &ldquo;With Todd's outstanding track record as a top performing healthcare IT and imaging sales executive, he will be a valuable asset in further penetrating the market as well as demonstrating the value of our cloud software-as-a-service technology and vendor neutral archive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior to joining DICOM Grid, McNitt was senior vice president of sales operations at <br>
  a Silicon Valley healthcare IT startup that improves financial and operational efficiencies by automating and tracking patient-flow in real time. Previously, he was general manager of Carestream Health&rsquo;s North American Healthcare IT business. In this role, he directed sales and marketing activities for the radiology information system (RIS), picture archiving communication system (PACS) and eHealth product portfolio.</p>
<p>Todd spent seven years with Fujifilm Medical Systems; during that time the company experienced exponential sales growth in the enterprise PACS market. <br>
  He also held sales leadership positions at Toshiba American Medical Systems.</p>
<p>&quot;I am looking forward to contributing to DICOM Grid&rsquo;s continued success,&rdquo; McNitt said. &ldquo;I am confident that my market knowledge, domain experience and relationships in the imaging market will greatly benefit the company as healthcare facilities increasingly look for innovative ways to improve access to diagnostic imaging studies and control costs – two issues that the DICOM Grid cloud platform helps to solve.&rdquo;</p>
