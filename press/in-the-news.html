			<h3>Mayo Clinic, DICOM Grid collaborate on mobile imaging</h3>
			<div><strong>Healthcare IT News | Sept 2012</strong></div>
      <div>
        <p>Mayo Clinic and Phoenix, Ariz.-based DICOM Grid are partnering to develop a mobile medical image viewer, meant to improve image sharing between Mayo, its physicians and referring physicians.</p>

<p>Designed specially for both iPad and browser-based devices, DICOM Grid’s technology allows doctors to exchange and view images regardless of geographic or institutional boundaries, officials say. The mobile application allows doctors and providers to send medical images to a facility in advance of a physician visit so that hospitals can more efficiently evaluate and treat patients.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic will work alongside DICOM Grid to provide expertise from the clinical perspective.</p>

			<h3>Software Division CEO Insights: Morris Panner, DICOMGrid</h3>
			<div><strong>(Interview) SIIA.net | September 2012</strong></div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Which markets will provide the best opportunities for tech companies in the next five years and why:</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important emerging trends in software today is true healthcare IT innovation. Traditionally, innovation and healthcare infrastructure simply did not go together. Innovation in healthcare was in drug discovery and medical devices. Healthcare IT was the red headed stepchild, dominated by legacy vendors. It would be as if Siebel still ruled the CRM roost.</p>
<p>A new generation of companies is changing that, driving new investment dollars and interest into the sector. A combination of demographics and regulation are creating an appetite in the healthcare industry for change.</p>
<p>First, there is the unavoidable math of an aging population and expanding healthcare needs. The cost pressures are far outstripping anyone’s budget expectations. As a result, innovation in how information is shared and used is a natural option for trying to control costs.</p>

			<h3>DICOM Grid Celebrates National Health IT Week September 10-14, 2012</h3>
			<div><strong>blog.dicomgrid.com | September 2012</strong></div>
      <div>
        <p>Health information technology improves the quality of healthcare delivery, increases patient safety, decreases medical errors, and strengthens the interaction between patients and healthcare providers.

			<h3>HIMSS: Cloud-based image sharing offers many benefits</h3>
			<div><strong>AuntMinnie.com | March 2012</strong></div>
			<div class=""><p>
Memorial Hermann is a large healthcare system in Houston with 15 total hospitals, including nine acute hospitals, one children's hospital, three heart and vascular institutes, and two rehabilitation hospitals. It also includes 29 imaging centers, 25 sports medicine and rehab centers, 25 diagnostic laboratories, 17 ambulatory surgical centers, one retirement/nursing center, and one home health agency, according to Bradshaw.
</p>
<p>
The Image Gateway, supplied by DICOM Grid, has provided improvements in patient care, the institution has found. For example, a 10-year-old girl in Beaumont, TX, had suffered a complex femur fracture after a fall. After the x-rays at the rural hospital had revealed the complex injury and the need for a higher level of care, the patient and images were transferred to the Texas Medical Center level I trauma center, Weeks said.
</p>
<p>
All of Memorial Hermann's imaging studies are now being sent to the cloud for disaster recovery/backup purposes. But the institution also sees the strategic opportunities to reuse those images, Bradshaw said.
</p>
<p>
"Now we access them through a URL and we have a unique study ID," he said. "We can start to move the study IDs into different places, such as different electronic medical records. We ultimately see moving this into a personal health record. Our strategy is that we want to be the first imaging center [where] you can get all of your images through a browser as a consumer."

			<h3>Cloud-based Image Exchange</h3>
			<div><strong>Advance for Imaging & Radiation Oncology | February 2012</strong></div>
			<div class=""><p>Hospitals increasingly are moving to facilitate real-time information flow to all parts of their organization through electronic health records (EHRs) and local or regional health information exchanges (HIEs). With the focus on continuity of care documents and other related structured data, the exchange of imaging studies is often not included in HIE projects.</p>

<p>Given the significant role imaging plays in diagnosis and treatment, organizations should not ignore the benefits they can realize. A secure cloud-based medical imaging exchange (MIE) can speed access to pertinent current and historical imaging studies. It securely connects referral hospitals, physicians, and specialists online, enabling organizations to leverage their existing RIS and PACS systems. Hospitals that deploy a medical image exchange can view and share images and reports with their referral partners in real time, without relying on physical media such as CDs.</p></div>

			<h3>Google Health shutdown spurs debate over PHR viability</h3>
			<div><strong>Healthcare IT News | November 2011</strong></div>
      <div class=""><p>While Google Health has faltered, the Radiological Society of North America is conducting a PHR project of its own. Funded by a $4.7 million grant from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, RNSA will be designing and launching an Internet-based network for patient-controlled sharing of medical images. The network will facilitate access to imaging exams for patients and physicians, “potentially reducing redundant examinations, minimizing patient radiation exposure and enabling better informed medical decisions,” an organization statement said</p></div>

			<h3>Vendor-neutral imaging systems provide efficiency, integration for hospitals</h3>
			<div><strong>Hospital Impact | May 2011</strong></div>
      <div class=""><p>Hospitals and health systems create, store and access images every day using proprietary picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). Radiologists typically must view and interpret images on-site because they cannot access their hospital's PACS remotely. Worse, their PACS cannot exchange images with other PACS, even when images in those disparate systems are stored in the standard DICOM format.</p></div>

			<h3>6 Issues to Consider: Cloud-Based Imaging for Your Hospital</h3>
			<div><strong>Becker’s Hospital Review | April 2011</strong></div>
      <div class=""><p>As hospitals move to integrate images with electronic records, they are finding that their legacy imaging technologies and manual processes for sharing images leave them poorly positioned to respond to market forces such as the pressure to improve quality and reduce costs. To meet the demands of the rapidly changing healthcare environment, providers are increasingly looking for ways to efficiently store and instantly share images and data with other physicians and patients. For many, that means transitioning to the cloud — easy, web-based medical imaging management that allows providers to search for, view and seamlessly exchange imaging data.</p></div>

			<h3>Collaboration via Clouds: A breast center owner shares top priorities and transition tips</h3>
			<div><strong>ADVANCE for Imaging & Radiation Oncology | March 2011</strong></div>
      <div class=""><p>In a world where we instantly send and receive information by texts, tweets, and emails, patients expect immediate answers to their important medical questions. When Arizona Breastnet, a full-service breast diagnostic center, opened its doors 13 years ago, our commitment was to give patients their test results at the time of their appointment, to answer all their questions, and to be available as an ongoing resource. This alleviates the wondering, worrying, and waiting after an exam. An empathetic staff of specially trained clinicians with outstanding knowledge and experience is at the core of what we do. They allow us to focus on the needs of our patients in comfortable, home-like surroundings. Our technology, business practices, and personal interaction support these goals for the nearly 6,000 patients we see annually.</p></div>

			<h3>Brave New World: Making the case for cloud-based management of medical imaging</h3>
			<div><strong>RT Image | January 2011</strong></div>
      <div class=""><p>Whether an imaging facility is free-standing, office-based, or in a hospital, it faces the same issues of efficiency and cost-effectiveness that are currently stressing all healthcare providers. While we may not know what reform will ultimately look like, we are sure it will bring increased volume, lower reimbursement, sharper oversight, and intensified competition. For all these reasons, cloud-based management of medical imaging — under the right conditions — makes good business sense.</p></div>
