<h2>DICOM Grid's History</h2>


<p>DICOM Grid was founded by neuroradiologists from Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. They were profoundly frustrated that technology was making their lives harder, not easier. Their patients were treated by a number of different physician groups and hospitals, each with different proprietary systems that did not speak to each other. They lacked the timely information essential to quality patient care, and their productivity as providers was being impaired. The cost of running their practice was escalating as they had to purchase additional equipment and hire additional IT staff to manage different systems.</p>

<p>They decided to bring proven technology advances from the consumer and enterprise markets into healthcare. They created DICOM Grid to realize their vision of a 21st-century cloud platform that would dramatically improve patient care by allowing physicians to use the web to collaborate with imaging data. As physicians, they understood this platform must be secure, easy to use, and cost effective. They designed and patented an unbreakable security model that makes imaging data cloud-safe and web-safe. This technological breakthrough led to the creation of the industry's most powerful and accessible cloud computing platform for medical imaging information.</p>

<p>Today, a growing and dedicated team is taking this vision forward. By leveraging ongoing advances in information technology and adapting them to the healthcare environment, DICOM Grid's cloud applications are solving the most vexing problems in diagnostic imaging. We're evolving our platform into a powerful knowledge system to help our customers truly transform how they practice medicine. Join us and discover what the power of the cloud can do for your healthcare enterprise.</p></div>
