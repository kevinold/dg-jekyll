<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>DG PHR provides patients with an easy and secure way to share their medical images with their physicians, enabling them to upload images from a CD, DVD, or thumb drive, as well as download and view their own images.</p>

<p>For patients online sharing of medical images has a series of benefits, particularly when there is also travel involved – either to see a specialist, or second opinion – or when the patient is moving around the country or around the world.</p>

<p>These benefits include the ability to access the images irrespective of the location of the patient or the healthcare provider, certainty that the images are readable and safe, and under your control. This all means that there is less likelihood of requiring another examination in order to recreate an existing (but lost) report, with all the time, money, and radiation exposure that this involves.</p>

<p>For providers online sharing of medical images improves the quality of patient care, while reducing the cost of dealing with moving images in and out of the local system. It use should meet the “Stage 2 Meaningful Use” of clinically relevant information between providers of care at care transitions.</p>

<h3 id='cd_handling_remote_importing_and_exporting'>CD handling, remote importing and exporting</h3>

<p>DG PHR allow patients to upload studies directly from their CDs or DVDs via your website, without the need for additional user software, improves the overall experience for the patient, the referring physician, and the entire care team. By immediately notifying via email or text all the care team – from patient, to physician, to specialist, when studies are received, read, and the diagnosis report prepared, the patient is kept up to date on their care, and the time that is wasted if the study cannot be read is minimized.</p>

<p>DG PHR provides patients with a unique web link to their study via text, email, fax, or printed paper allows them to either remotely view the images or download the study and burn it to disk – or download it directly to their physician’s computer, and hence gives them easy access to their own health records.</p>

<p>Studies can be merged, images added or deleted and demographic data removed or changed (automated DMWL). Workflow and Quality Assurance</p>

<p>DG PHR offers end to end workflow management and automation so ensuring the smooth delivery of images to the right destination, in the right format.</p>

<p>Notification of events by email or text after any event, including success and failure or any process ensure that the entire care team, including the patient, is able to follow the progress the imaging study and know when their input is required.</p>

<h3 id='remote_viewing'>Remote Viewing</h3>

<p>DG Mobile is DG&#8217;s secure zero-footprint remote viewer for medical images – it supports a wide range of viewing devices; from iPads to Windows laptops. It has been designed from the ground up to work over limited bandwidth networks - only the relevant images are delivered to the viewer, and a secure connection is used for all data. There is no initial software download required and hence the time to first image is much faster than other products on the market (many of which need a Java download, download the whole image, and do not use a secure connection - hence putting patient data at risk).</p>

<p>Remote viewing is a key piece of the PHR solution because it allows both the patient and their care team to quickly see any image at any time. So they can be sure that the image is of sufficient quality and correct content when it first arrives, without requiring it to be downloaded and imported into a full diagnostic system. It also allows the patient to show their images to specialists who may not have access to the relevant diagnostic reader and hence would normally be totally reliant on the written report.</p>

<h3 id='security_logging_access_control_and_external_apis'>Security, Logging, Access Control, and External APIs</h3>

<p>The DG platform provides a uniform access and control model for all components in the DG solution suite – hence ensuring consistent and secure access to medical images and reports.</p>
