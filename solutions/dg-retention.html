<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>DG Retention provides medical organizations with a cost effective, flexible, and secure retention system for their medical images. The DG Retention solution makes it very easy to manipulate the archive – from searching and viewing a particular study, to automatically deleting third party studies (where there is no obligation to archive), and restoring individual studies that may have been accidently deleted from the primary storage.</p>

<h2 id='features_and_benefits'>Features and Benefits</h2>

<p>The DG Retention solution consists of three core modules:</p>

<h3 id='image_routing_and_distribution'>Image Routing and Distribution</h3>

<p>DG Retention is able to retrieve images and studies from PACS and Modalities irrespective of the vendor using a local DG Gateway which acts as a buffer between the local devices and the DG Imagebank where the data is stored long term.</p>

<p>The DG Imagebank can be located in DG’s secure datacenter and provided as a service, or it can be located in your datacenter and use your existing storage and backup solution – but with the benefit of providing a single interface for the management of all the stored images and studies.</p>

<p>The DG Retention solution is particularly useful for the recovery of studies because it allows the studies to be viewed while still on the DG Imagebank, and then moved to any PACS or Modality, irrespective of their origin. So facilitating the consolidation of PACS, or the integration of a new hospital or care facility into an existing organization.</p>

<p>Studies can even be transferred to and from workshops such as Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac machines – so allowing the use of Dicom Viewers such as OsiriX Imaging Software from Pixmeo, ClearCanvas Workstation, and Merge Healthcare eFilm Mobile.</p>

<h3 id='workflow_and_quality_assurance'>Workflow and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>DG offers end to end workflow management and automation to ensure that a high quality result is delivered each and every time, with the minimum of manual intervention, hence reducing costs and maximizing revenue.</p>

<p>The workflow covers all aspects of image archiving and retrieval, so enabling intelligent archiving that, for example, only archives images and studies that are your responsibility and not studies that were made at another institution.</p>

<p>Retention policies can be dynamically applied to studies so that different studies can be stored in different locations, and on different types of storage system.</p>

<p>Workflows are designed via the web interface, and triggered by a range of inputs, including HL7 data from the RIS (Radiology Information System).</p>

<p>Notification of events by email or text after any event, including success and failure or any process ensure that the entire care team is able to follow the progress the imaging study and know when their input is required.</p>

<h3 id='dg_mobile_zerofootprint_viewing'>Zero-footprint Viewing</h3>

<p>DG Retention enables members of the extended care team to see Medical Images, reports, and studies irrespective of the user’s location. By leveraging the centralized image store and unified directory it provides a secure and easy way to access any image at any time, while protecting the core PACS and Modalities.</p>

<p>DG Mobile is DG&#8217;s secure zero-footprint remote viewer for medical images – it supports a wide range of viewing devices; from iPads to Windows laptops. It has been designed from the ground up to work overlimited bandwidth networks - only the relevant images are delivered to the viewer, and a secure connection is used for all data. There is no initial software download required and hence the time to first image is much faster than other products on the market (many of which need a Java download, download the whole image, and do not use a secure connection - hence putting patient data at risk).</p>

<h3 id='security_logging_access_control_and_external_apis'>Security, Logging, Access Control, and External APIs</h3>

<p>The DG platform provides a uniform access and control model for all components in the DG solution suite – hence ensuring consistent and secure access to medical images and reports, and compliance with Title 21 CFR part II.</p>

<p>All users are assigned to particular organizational roles, and each role has an associated security policy, so changing the policy for a particular group of users simply means changing that one role rather than the policy associated with each individual user. Besides reducing the time and effort involved this approach reduces the risk of error and improves the security of the system.</p>

<p>All actions are logged and these logged can be analyzed by action, location, and user.</p>

<p>The DG solution is built from a series of discrete systems, each with their own REST API, which is used to bind the system together. These documented APIs can be used to extend the DG solution, and integrate it with other IT solutions.</p>
