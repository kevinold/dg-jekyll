    		<h1>DICOM Grid Advances Interoperable Medical Image Management</h1>
		<div><p><em>DICOM Grid&rsquo;s affordable cloud-based solution provides secure, 24-7 anywhere access to medical images and studies to improve care, ensure business continuity and disaster recovery </em></p>
<p><strong>ORLANDO, Fla. (HIMSS) – Feb. 21, 2011 </strong>– <a href="../../index.html">DICOM Grid</a>, a global cloud platform for medical imaging applications, today announced that its flagship cloud-based medical imaging management platform provided authorized physicians and healthcare facilities with access to more than 2 million imaging studies during its first year of production. The patented, vendor-neutral platform enables secure easy access and sharing of high-fidelity and low-latency images, data and reports to facilitate timely diagnosis, treatment and care collaboration. </p>
<p>Often for the cost of storing and archiving imaging studies in inaccessible data silos, DICOM Grid allows authorized users to immediately identify and access all related prior studies regardless of where or when they were created and this information can be transferred within and across facilities. This not only helps pinpoint and accelerate appropriate treatment, but can significantly reduce radiation exposure and the $3 to $10 billion that are wasted each year on unnecessary duplicate imaging studies.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing hospitals, independent delivery networks (IDNs) and imaging centers provide access to the DICOM Grid to referring physicians at no charge, especially radiologists, oncologists, neurologists, and cardiologists who often need images from prior exams to support clinical decision-making. Offering this access facilitates collaborative care and strengthens relationships with these physicians, which can have a significant bottom-line impact -- some specialists can generate up to $75,000 for certain procedures,&rdquo; said DICOM Grid CEO Michael V. Wall. &ldquo;In addition to enhancing physician relations, healthcare providers also report improved patient care, significant savings, streamlined workflow and improved patient satisfaction. They also mention achieving peace of mind from knowing that they comply with HIPAA and government archival regulations and knowing that DICOM Grid provides proven disaster recovery and business continuity. Unplanned downtime, planned upgrades and PACS migrations do happen – more often more than we like, with significant financial implications. For example, a planned or unplanned PACS outage can cost more than $10,000 a day for a medium-sized hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past year, DICOM Grid also:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Secured $7.5 million in Series A      financing.</li>
  <li>Released the scalable, affordable      cloud-based ImageCare platform and tools that make searching, sharing and      exchanging medical images as easy as using consumer web applications such      as Google, Facebook and iTunes. </li>
  <li>Expanded industry-savvy executive      management, sales and marketing, and product development teams to fuel      growth and build awareness about how DICOM Grid&rsquo;s cloud-based technology      platform can help their customers achieve a sustainable competitive      advantage.</li>
  <li>Received a patent on Split/Merge      technology that ensures secure capture, storage and transfer of images and      data by de-identifying the image by separating the image and patient      history, which are compressed, encrypted, indexed and stored. The two      records are only merged when they arrive on an authorized physician&rsquo;s      browser. supporting patents have been filed.</li>
  <li>Developed elastic, extremely      affordable cloud-based storage to accommodate burgeoning storage capacity      needs that enables nearly instant retrieval of images and reports.  </li>
  <li>Offered pricing and programs to      allow customers to leverage their existing technology, a boon to many      facilities with expensive, but incompatible systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The ability to share, browse, exchange and act upon medical imaging – whenever and wherever needed – is fundamental for care collaboration, the keystone of Meaningful Use,&rdquo; explained Wall. &ldquo;Imaging data provides a rich, but untapped source of valuable data that is currently held hostage by incompatible legacy and proprietary systems, devices and data silos. DICOM Grid&rsquo;s ImageCare platform breaks through these barriers to unleash this data to improve providers&rsquo; clinical, operational and financial outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
