	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>DICOM Grid, Inc.  (“DICOM Grid”) is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and security online. DICOM Grid recognizes privacy and security as being a concern for many individuals accessing the Internet. While we’ve structured our web sites so that, in general, you can visit DICOM Grid on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any Personal Information, you may be required to provide Personal Information (as defined below) to access certain secured and detailed information and materials.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.  “Anonymous Information” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.  We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Information, as described below.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy outlines DICOM Grid’s Personal Information handling practices. Once you choose to provide DICOM Grid with Personal Information, such Personal Information is only used to support your customer relationship with DICOM Grid.</p>

<p>DICOM Grid provides this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, DICOM Grid makes it available on our homepage at www.dicomgrid.com.</p>

<p>Finally, by using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by DICOM Grid as set forth in the Privacy Policy currently in effect. DICOM Grid reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time. If DICOM Grid does decide to change its Privacy Policy, such changes will be posted on DICOM Grid’s web site. Thus, we recommend checking back periodically to ensure that you are aware of the most current Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
<p>If you provide DICOM Grid with feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</p>  

<p>In addition, our web server storage logs can collect the domain names of visitors to its Web sites. This information is aggregated (as Anonymous Information) to measure number of visits, average time spent on the Dicomgrid.com Web site, pages viewed, etc. DICOM Grid uses this information to measure the use of our sites and to improve the content of our sites, such as through customization.</p>

<h3>WHO IS COLLECTING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

The DICOM Grid Web site may contain various links to third-party Web sites. These sites may provide additional information, goods, services and/or promotions. It should be understood that these sites are owned and operated independently of DICOM Grid, and have their own separate privacy and data collection practices. Please be aware that these third-party Web sites are not covered under this Privacy Policy. Instead, any information you provide to these Web sites will be governed under the terms of their privacy policy, if any.

We may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. Taking part in any of these segments is always optional. At a minimum, we give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact.
