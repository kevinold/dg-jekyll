# Platform

The DG system consists of two components; DG Gateways and the DG Imagebank.

## DG Gateway

The DG Gateway communicates with all the Modalities and PACS located on that network segment, and communicates directly and securely with the DG Imagebank.

It is a Microsoft Windows application that runs on a Microsoft Windows Server running Windows 2003 or above. It is typically placed on the same network segment as the Modalities and PACS. 

## DG Imagebank

The DG Imagebank is the central directory for all images and studies. It also contains copies of all the studies stored by the system. These can be restored to any connected PACS or Modality.

The DG Imagebank can either be hosted in our Phoenix, AZ based secure datacenter, and we will provide the solution to you as a service- or it can run onsite in your datacenter on your hardware.

Hybrid solutions are also possible where we act as backup to your in-house system.
