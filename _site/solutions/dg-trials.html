<h1 id='global_clinical_trial_medical_image_management'>Global Clinical Trial Medical Image Management</h1>

<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Today many clinical trials are conducted globally, with investigator sites in both developed and underdeveloped countries.</p>

<p>These clinical trials often require medical images from these global sites to be submitted to a Contract research Organization (CRO) that runs the trials. These CROs will often end up managing images from tens of thousands of investigator sites and managing hundreds of thousands of users seeking access to the Clinical Trial Medical Image Management system.</p>

<p>Investigators use a very wide range of computer equipment, in their own language, and they connect to the Internet which varies widely in its capacity and its reliability.</p>

<p>Medical Images are typically very large, and so the volume of data generated by these clinical trials is enormous. So is the value, for US approval the clinical trial management system has to be compliant with FDA (Title 21 CFR Part 11) regulation. This sets out rigorous guidelines on how these electronic records must be treated in order to be trustworthy, reliable and equivalent to paper records.</p>

<p>US Federal HIPAA privacy standards and the European standards on confidentiality and privacy in healthcare, are but two of many global regulations focused on ensuring that patient privacy is protected. This often means that the patient demographic section of a Dicom image file is modified with the patient name replaced by a patient code name, and the patient ID replaced by a trial-specific ID.</p>

<p>Each image generated by an investigator needs to be associated with a particular clinical trial, and then submitted into the Clinical Trial Medical Image Management system, where it is received, quality checked, processed, and analyzed, and a study report written. Each step of the process requires notifying the relevant people, especially if the image cannot proceed to the next step for any reason (such as poor image quality).</p>

<p>Different types of users have different views and access to the clinical data. So the investigator can see all the studies they have submitted, and the progress of those studies through the analysis steps, while other classes of user would only have a clinical view of studies which would mask the origin (patient and site) of the study. For ease of use, Investigators need to be able to navigate the system in one of a number of languages.</p>

<p>The Title 21 CFR Part 11 requirements require that all user access is controlled, and logged, and effectively means a very flexible role based user access control system.</p>

<p>The scale of these trials obviously places a very significant load on the Global Clinical Trial Medical Image Management system, and the global nature of the investigators requires 24/7 availability. The DG Global Clinical Trial Medical Image Management system addresses these requirements in a scalable and cost effective manner. ￼</p>

<h2 id='features_and_benefits'>Features and Benefits</h2>

<p>The DG Global Clinical Trial Medical Image Management solution tightly integrates the six core components of a solution into a single system with a common user interface, terminology, and user credentials.</p>

<h3 id='investigator_site_support'>Investigator Site Support</h3>

<p>The DG Global Clinical Trial Medical Image Management solution allow investigators with minimal image management infrastructure to upload studies, images, and reports directly from their CDs or DVDs via a dedicated website to the central imagebank, without the need for additional user software. The investigator and relevant members of the CRO are notified via email or text , when studies are received, pass (or fail) Q/A, are read, and the diagnosis report prepared, so minimizing time wasted chasing the status of studies.</p>

<p>This browser based approach is not require any inbound ports on the Investigator’s firewall to be open, as all communication is conducted on well known (80, and 443) outbound ports.</p>

<h3 id='image_routing_and_distribution'>Image Routing and Distribution</h3>

<p>Large Investigator sites, Sponsor organizations, and the CRO itself often need to move large volumes of studies between locations.</p>

<p>This problem is traditionally solved with point to point IP based data connections – using VPNs if the data has to travel over the public Internet.</p>

<p>There is considerable setup cost and time for each connection, both for the underlying VPN and Firewall modifications, but also to ensure that the data flows correctly between the different systems, which often requires custom developed data mapping rules.</p>

<p>The DG solution avoids the need for VPNs or Firewall modifications. All the data correction and remapping is done by the DG Imagebank, so the studies simply flow (push or pull) via the local DG Gateway to the cloud, and return to the DG Gateway in the remote location where they are cached and imported into the destination PACS or Modality.</p>

<p>DG’s patented “split-merge” technology ensures a high level of data security by automatically splitting the demographic data from the image data. The demographic data is significantly smaller and so can easily be encrypted and transmitted or stored independently of the image data. In addition the user name and patient ID are replaced by trial specific anonymous identifiers – hence reducing the risk of HIPAA compliance failures.</p>

<p>Studies can also be transferred to and from workshops such as Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac machines – so allowing the use of Dicom Viewers such as OsiriX Imaging Software from Pixmeo.</p>

<h3 id='workflow_and_quality_assurance'>Workflow and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>DG offers end to end workflow management and automation to ensure that a high quality result is delivered each and every time, with the minimum of manual intervention, hence reducing costs and maximizing revenue.</p>

<p>The workflow covers from the initial image and study importing from a CD, DVD, web upload, or modality to the demographic conciliation, to the routing, remote viewing, and exporting to CD, DVD, web download, or modality.</p>

<p>Workflows are designed via the web interface, and triggered by a range of inputs, including HL7 data from the RIS (Radiology Information System).</p>

<p>Workflow policies include; duplicate images, detecting and repairing demographic data, study compression (JPEG Baseline, JPEG Lossless or RLE transfer syntaxes)- including variable compression ratios (for lossy compression), minimum retention times, study anonymization, auto-forward, auto-fetch, pre-fetch, auto-route, assignment of studies to work-lists, and notifications.</p>

<p>Notification of events by email or text after any event, including success and failure or any process ensure that the entire care team is able to follow the progress the imaging study and know when their input is required.</p>

<h3 id='dg_mobile_zerofootprint_viewing'>DG Mobile: Zero-footprint Viewing</h3>

<p>Enabling a wide range of credentialed users to view anonymized images from their mobile devices such as iPads and laptops, wherever they are in the world speeds up the clinical trial process, saving time, money, and increasing the revenue from sales (the patent clock is running during the trial process).</p>

<p>DG Mobile is DG&#8217;s secure zero-footprint remote viewer for medical images – it supports a wide range of viewing devices; from iPads to Windows laptops. It has been designed from the ground up to work over limited bandwidth networks - only the relevant images are delivered to the viewer, and a secure connection is used for all data. There is no initial software download required and hence the time to first image is much faster than other products on the market (many of which need a Java download, download the whole image, and do not use a secure connection - hence putting patient data at risk). ￼</p>

<h3 id='security_logging_access_control_and_external_apis'>Security, Logging, Access Control, and External APIs</h3>

<p>The DG platform provides a uniform access and control model for all components in the DG solution suite – hence ensuring consistent and secure access to medical images and reports, and compliance with Title 21 CFR part II.</p>

<p>All users are assigned to particular organizational roles, and each role has an associated security policy, so changing the policy for a particular group of users simply means changing that one role rather than the policy associated with each individual user. Besides reducing the time and effort involved this approach reduces the risk of error and improves the security of the system.</p>

<p>All actions are logged and these logged can be analyzed by action, location, and user.</p>

<p>The DG solution is built from a series of discrete systems, each with their own REST API, which is used to bind the system together. These documented APIs can be used to extend the DG solution, and integrate it with other IT solutions.</p>
