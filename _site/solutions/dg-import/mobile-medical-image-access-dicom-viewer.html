<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>DG Import provides a secure, scalable and intuitive solution for importing images and studies from a wide range of media (CDs, DVDs, thumb drives), and managing the workflow needed to quality assure the imports, correct demographic data, and import into the PACS.</p>

<h2>Features and Benefits</h2>

<p>DG Import solution tightly integrates the six core components of a solution into a single system with a common user interface, terminology, and user credentials.</p>

<h3>CD handling, remote importing and exporting</h3>

<p>DG Import allow patients to upload studies directly from their CDs or DVDs via your website, without the need for additional user software, improves the overall experience for the patient, the referring physician, and the entire care team. By immediately notifying via email or text all the care team – from patient, to physician, to specialist, when studies are received, read, and the diagnosis report prepared, the patient is kept up to date on their care, and the time that is wasted if the study cannot be read is minimized.</p>

<p>It provides patients with a unique web link to their study via text, email, fax, or printed paper allows them to either remotely view the images or download the study and burn it to disk – or download it directly to their physician’s computer, and hence gives them easy access to their own health records.</p>

<p>Studies can be merged, images added or deleted and demographic data removed or changed.</p>

<h3>Image Routing and Distribution</h3>

<p>Moving images between PACS, as well as between PACS and modalities is traditionally solved with point to point IP based data connections – using VPNs if the data has to travel over the public Internet.</p>

<p>There is considerable setup cost and time for each connection, both for the underlying VPN and Firewall modifications, but also to ensure that the data flows correctly between the different systems, which often requires custom developed data mapping rules.</p>

<p>The DG solution avoids the need for VPNs or Firewall modifications. All the data correction and remapping is done by the DG Imagebank, so the studies simply flow (push or pull) via the local DG Gateway to the cloud, and return to the DG Gateway in the remote location where they are cached and imported into the destination PACS or Modality.</p>

<p>DG’s patented “split-merge” technology ensures a high level of data security by automatically splitting the demographic data from the image data. The demographic data is significantly smaller and so can easily be encrypted and transmitted or stored independently of the image data. When the study is required then the demographic data can be re-inserted at the destination – hence reducing the risk of HIPAA compliance failures.</p>

<p>Studies can also be transferred to and from workshops such as Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac machines – so allowing the use of Dicom Viewers such as OsiriX Imaging Software from Pixmeo, ClearCanvas Workstation, and Merge Healthcare eFilm Mobile.</p>

<h3>Workflow and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>DG offers end to end workflow management and automation to ensure that a high quality result is delivered each and every time, with the minimum of manual intervention, hence reducing costs and maximizing revenue.</p>

<p>The workflow covers from the initial image and study importing from a CD, DVD, web upload, or modality to the demographic conciliation, to the routing, remote viewing, and exporting to CD, DVD, web download, or modality.</p>

<p>Workflows are designed via the web interface, and triggered by a range of inputs, including HL7 data from the RIS (Radiology Information System).</p>

<p>Workflow policies include; duplicate images, detecting and repairing demographic data, study compression (JPEG Baseline, JPEG Lossless or RLE transfer syntaxes)- including variable compression ratios (for lossy compression), minimum retention times, study anonymization, auto-forward, auto-fetch, pre-fetch, auto-route, assignment of studies to work-lists, and notifications.</p>

<p>Notification of events by email or text after any event, including success and failure or any process ensure that the entire care team is able to follow the progress the imaging study and know when their input is required.</p>

<h3>Zero-footprint Image Viewing</h3>

<p>Sharing medical images with the entire care team –from referring physician and patient to medical specialists, such as surgeons is often a time consuming and inefficient process, so often only the diagnosis report is shared. But images are a very powerful way to convey information, especially to the patient, even if they don’t have the training to understand all the detail. So having the surgeon use an iPad to show the patient before surgery what is going to happen is a powerful way of including them.</p>

<p>DG’s secure zero-footprint remote viewer for medical images supports a wide range of viewing devices; from iPads to Windows laptops. It has been designed from the ground up to work over limited bandwidth networks such as cellular networks - only the relevant images are delivered to the viewer, and a secure connection is used for all data. There is no initial software download required and hence the time to first image is no slowed by the need to first download the viewer.</p>

<h3>HL7 Reports</h3>

<p>Patient Demographic data and the diagnosis reports are normally contained in the RIS (Radiology Information System), rather than in the PACS – which is focused on the studies themselves.</p>

<p>The DG Import system pulls radiology reports from the HL7 and combines them with the relevant studies so that they can be moved and accessed as a single item.</p>

<h3>Security, Logging, Access Control, and External APIs</h3>

<p>The DG platform provides a uniform access and control model for all components in the DG solution suite – hence ensuring consistent and secure access to medical images and reports.</p>

<p>All users are assigned to particular organizational roles, and each role has an associated security policy, so changing the policy for a particular group of users simply means changing that one role rather than the policy associated with each individual user. Besides reducing the time and effort involved this approach reduces the risk of error and improves the security of the system.</p>

<p>All actions are logged and these logged can be analyzed by action, location, and user.</p>

<p>The DG solution is built from a series of discrete systems, each with their own REST API, which is used to bind the system together. These documented APIs can be used to extend the DG solution, and integrate it with other IT solutions.</p>
